## Summary
The Doc Locator allows the user to input a city, address, or zipcode and retrieve a list of doctors located nearby. The search results are displayed as both a list and on Google Maps to aid the user in browsing nearby doctors. Search results can be filtered based on physician specialty and gender.

## Live Site

## Implementation
* The physician location and other meta data are available via the [BetterDoctor.com](https://betterdoctor.com/) API.
* Geocoding and map visualization is provided by the Google Maps Javascript API.    
* Form submission, asynchronous API calls (AJAX), and DOM manipulation were done using Javascript and jQuery.
* A responsive and mobile ready site was built using HTML5 and CSS3.
